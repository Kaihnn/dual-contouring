# Project Instructions

## Context
- **Project**: Dual Contouring algorithm implementation
- **Engine**: Unity
- **Architecture**: Entity Component System (ECS)
- **Language**: C#
- **Code language**: All code, variable names, method names, and class names must be in English

## C# Coding Standards
- Strictly follow C# naming conventions:
  - `PascalCase` for classes, methods, properties, and types
  - `camelCase` for local variables and parameters
  - `_camelCase` for private fields (optional depending on project style)
- Follow .NET and Unity ECS standards
- **NO COMMENTS in code**: favor self-documenting code with explicit and well-chosen names
- Names must be descriptive and reveal intent
- Prefer short methods focused on a single responsibility
- Prioritize performance in mesh generation code and ECS systems
